# Architecture

## Game State Module
- Added `src/game/Game.ts` as the centralized state container for core Tic-Tac-Toe data.
- `Game` module exports shared domain types: `Player`, `Board`, `Move`, `GameStatus`, and `GameState`.
- `Game` class owns in-memory game state and exposes read APIs: `getState()`, `getBoard()`, `getMoves()`, `getCurrentPlayer()`, and `getStatus()`.
- Read methods return copies to keep internal state predictable and prevent external mutation.
- Added move APIs for gameplay progression:
  - `canPlaceMove(position)` validates board index, game-over state, and empty-cell requirement.
  - `placeMove(position)` safely rejects invalid placements and, on valid moves, records ordered move history and alternates current player.
- Added game resolution logic in `Game`:
  - Evaluates all 8 Tic-Tac-Toe winning lines after each valid move.
  - Sets `status.winner` and `status.isOver` immediately when a winning line is formed.
  - Sets draw status when the board is full with no winner.
  - Prevents additional moves after game over through `canPlaceMove(position)`.

## CPU Move Selection
- CPU move selection is handled in gameplay UI turn effect when `currentPlayer` is `O`.
- Selection strategy uses deterministic minimax scoring:
  - Enumerates all legal open positions.
  - Simulates move outcomes recursively for both players until terminal state (CPU win, player win, or draw).
  - Chooses highest-scoring move for CPU, preferring faster wins and slower losses.
- Tie-breaking across equivalent scores uses fixed board priority (`[4, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]`) to keep behavior stable and testable.
